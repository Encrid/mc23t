# .toolchain/tools/runner.py

`runner.py` writes the commands that give a runner of GitHub what the cases of the project need, for example a display.
The workflows `ci` and `release` give these commands to `bash`, before the step `Fetch`:

```sh
python .toolchain/tools/runner.py --target <target> | bash -e
```

## The needs

`[ci] needs` of the configuration lists the needs of the project: `.toolchain/docs/project.toml.md`, *[ci]*.
`[runner]` of `.toolchain/toolchain.toml` gives the packages and the archives: `.toolchain/docs/toolchain.toml.md`, *[runner]*.

| Need | Linux | Windows | macOS |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `display` | Xvfb, a server of X11 with no screen, and the window manager Openbox on it. Then weston, a server of Wayland with no screen. | Nothing: the runner has a desktop. | Nothing: the runner has a desktop. |
| `vulkan` | The packages `libvulkan1` and `mesa-vulkan-drivers`. They give lavapipe, the Vulkan of Mesa that runs on the processor. | The lavapipe of a release of `mmozeiko/build-mesa`, and the loader `vulkan-1.dll` of the runtime of LunarG. | The packages `mesa` and `vulkan-loader` of Homebrew. `mesa` gives lavapipe. |
| `gl` | The packages `libgl1`, `libglx-mesa0` and `libgl1-mesa-dri`. | The file `opengl32.dll` of Mesa, from a release of `mmozeiko/build-mesa`. | Nothing: OpenGL is part of the system. |

`runner.py` writes the commands for the target of `--target`, or for the target of this machine.
`runs_on` of the target gives its system and its processor.
With no need, or with no need on the system, `runner.py` writes nothing. Then `bash` does nothing.

## Linux

The commands do these steps:

1. They run `sudo apt-get update`, then one `sudo apt-get install -y` with the packages of each need, in the order of their names.
2. For `display`, they start Xvfb on the display `:99`, with a screen of 1920 by 1080 pixels and 24 bits.
3. They wait for the socket of the display, then start Openbox on it.
4. They make the folder `$RUNNER_TEMP/wayland`, which only its owner can read, write and open.
5. They start weston in that folder, with its backend `headless`, its renderer `pixman` and the socket `wayland-1`.
6. They wait for that socket.
7. They write `DISPLAY`, `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` and `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` into `$GITHUB_ENV`. Thus each later step finds the 2 displays.

Xvfb, Openbox and weston run in the background, and send their output to `/dev/null`. They keep running in the later steps of the job.
A wait stops after 10 seconds with a failure, and then the step fails.
weston runs with `--no-config`, so no file of the runner changes it.

## Windows

For `gl`, the commands do these steps:

1. They download the archive `llvmpipe` of `[runner] mesa.url`, with the `arch` of the processor, into the folder `mesa` of `$RUNNER_TEMP`.
2. They check the SHA-256 digest of the archive, from `[runner] mesa.llvmpipe`.
3. The `tar.exe` of Windows unpacks `opengl32.dll`. The `tar` of Git cannot unpack a `.7z`.
4. They write `SDL_OPENGL_LIBRARY`, the whole path of the file, into `$GITHUB_ENV`.

Windows finds the `opengl32.dll` of its folder `System32` before the folders of `PATH`. So a library that loads OpenGL needs the whole path.

For `vulkan`, the commands do these steps:

1. They download the archive `lavapipe` of `[runner] mesa.url` into the folder `vulkan` of `$RUNNER_TEMP`. They check its digest from `[runner] mesa.lavapipe`. They unpack it: the driver `vulkan_lvp.dll` and its file of ICD.
2. They download the archive of `[runner] loader.url`, and check its digest from `[runner] loader`. They unpack its `file`, the loader `vulkan-1.dll`, into the same folder. `--strip-components` drops the folders of the path of `file`.
3. They write `VK_DRIVER_FILES` and `VK_ICD_FILENAMES`, the whole path of the file of ICD from `[runner] icd`, into `$GITHUB_ENV`. Thus the loader finds only lavapipe. The second name serves the loaders that know no `VK_DRIVER_FILES`.
4. They write `VULKAN_LOADER`, the whole path of `vulkan-1.dll`, into `$GITHUB_ENV`. A program that names no loader of its own loads the loader at that path.
   Windows finds the `vulkan-1.dll` of its folder `System32` before the folders of `PATH`. The runner image holds an old loader there.
5. They write the folder into `$GITHUB_PATH`. Thus a program finds `vulkan-1.dll` as on a machine with the runtime of Vulkan.

## macOS

For `vulkan`, the commands do these steps:

1. They install the packages of `[runner] brews.vulkan` with Homebrew.
2. They write `VK_DRIVER_FILES`, the file of ICD of lavapipe from `[runner] icd` in the prefix of Homebrew, into `$GITHUB_ENV`.
3. They write `VULKAN_LOADER`, the whole path of `libvulkan.1.dylib` in the prefix of Homebrew, into `$GITHUB_ENV`. A program loads the loader from that path, because the prefix of Homebrew is not a folder that `dlopen` searches.

`display` and `gl` need nothing on macOS: the runner has a desktop, and OpenGL is part of the system.

## Output

`runner.py` writes each command on its own line, with the line end of Linux on each system. `bash` reads a carriage return as a part of a command.
It stops with these messages:

- `[ci] needs: <need> is not a need: display gl vulkan`
- `no machine runs the target <target>`

## Functions

| Function | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `archive(name, file, url, digest, members)` | Gives the commands that download an archive into the folder `name`, check its digest and unpack `members` of it. |
| `mesa(runner, driver, cpu, name, file, members)` | Gives the commands of `archive` for the archive `driver` of Mesa, for a processor of Windows. |
| `windows(needs, cpu, runner)` | Gives the commands of `gl` and `vulkan` on Windows. |
| `commands(needs, machine, runner)` | Gives the commands of the needs for a machine, as `runs_on` names the machine. `runner` is `[runner]` of the configuration. |
| `main()` | Reads the options and the needs, and writes the commands. |
